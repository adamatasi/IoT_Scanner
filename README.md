1-	General Information

1.1	Introduction
The Internet of Things or IoT is influencing our lifestyle from the way we react to the way we behave. From air conditioners that you can control with your smartphone to Smart Cars providing the shortest route or your Smartwatch which is tracking your daily activities. IoT is a giant network with connected devices. These devices gather and share data about how they are used and the environment in which they are operated.

1.2	Why IoT Scanner?
Anybody who is concerned with WIFI security and personal computer/laptop. For Example, Fleming college, McDonald’s, Tim Horton, hotels, and home network. The IoT Tester can help scan the network you are connected to and list all vulnerabilities so we can be protected and detect any potential threat. This device offers detailed information (name, range, IP address, etc.) of all connected devices with detected vulnerabilities by checking and comparing from the in-built database.

1.3	Why Our IoT Scanner?
What makes this tester superior to most others on the market is its ability to detect Bluetooth devices not just devices on Wi-Fi networks. This tester will be connected to your system and performance will depend on your system specification.
Features:
Easy use - Nice and Simple graphical user interface - Fast responsive execution - Deliver results via email.

2-	Getting started

2.1	Requirements
You need to have either a Raspberry Pi handed by us OR a setup.sh file That you can download from Dropbox. (Link is Below at 3.1).
-	If you get the Raspberry Pi from us, all you need to do is to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Wi-Fi.
o	On the upper right corner CLICK the Wi-Fi symbol > Choose your Wi-Fi network > Type your Wi-Fi password.
o	You will see a file called “setup.sh” on your Desktop that is ready to run. DOUBLE CLICK the file > Execute OR Execute in Terminal.
-	If you have your own Raspberry Pi, you can skip a few steps and go to (3.1).
-	
2.2	The Raspberry Pi
In order to use the Raspberry Pi computer, you need the following accessories:
-	A power adapter (included).
-	SD Card (included and configured).
-	A computer monitor, or television. Most should work as a display for the Raspberry Pi, but for best results, you should use a display with HDMI input. You’ll also need an appropriate display cable, to connect your monitor to your Raspberry Pi.
-	A computer keyboard and mouse
o	Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi.
o	Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.
Raspberry Pi Documentation - Getting Started

2.3	Connecting the SD Card
Raspberry Pi computers use a micro-SD card, except for very early models which use a full-sized SD card. This card (64GB) will be included and configured for users, so they don’t have to install an operating system.

2.4	Connecting the Display
Your Raspberry Pi has an HDMI port which you can connect directly to a monitor or TV with an HDMI cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, some do not, but there are other options. (We will include the HDMI cable with the Raspberry Pi).

2.5	Connecting the Keyboard and the Mouse
You will be receiving a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B that has 2x USB 3.0 AND 2x USB 2.0 ports. Connect your keyboard and mouse to two of them.

2.6	Power On the Raspberry Pi
After connecting the accessories, connect the power supply and the Raspberry Pi will start automatically (There is no POWER ON/OFF on the Raspberry Pi). Then, you will be logged in to the machine and directed to the Desktop.

2.7	Running the Setup file
After powering on the machine, you will see our setup file on the desktop. Don’t run it yet. You can skip a few steps and go directly to (3.3).

3-	Step-by-Step instructions
You can either watch the video to see how it's done OR follow the instructions below.
Video Link: https://youtu.be/6sr7vAXrZN4
3.1	setup.sh file
The user needs to have our file "setup.sh". When running this file for the first time, it will install the latest system update (update the packages), Python3, Python-pip3, and some Python modules required to complete the scan and run our app. The modules include Tkinter (used for the GUI), Bluetooth (to scan for Bluetooth devices), and nvdlib (to get info about vulnerabilities and CVEs from the NVD Library).
You can download the file from the following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kilsloe52vm8xp/setup.sh?dl=0
3.2	Changing the permissions
After downloading the setup.sh file, you will need to change the "Execute permissions" to anyone so you can run the file in your machine.
There are two ways to change the permissions (The first way is much easier):
1-	Right Click the file (setup.sh) > Properties > Go to Permissions tab > Change "Execute" to "Anyone".
 
2-	Right Click the file (setup.sh) > Properties > Under General > Copy the location of the file (path) > On the top left corner or down left corner > Click your Raspberry Pi logo > Choose "Accessories" > Terminal > Type without brackets (cd AND_THEN_PASTE_THE_COPIED_LOCATION) > Hit Enter
> Now type without brackets (chmod +x setup.sh) > Hit Enter
 
3.3	Running the setup.sh file
You can either watch the video to see how it's done OR follow the instructions below.
Video Link: https://youtu.be/6sr7vAXrZN4
Now, you can run the setup file.
Double click the setup.sh file and then choose either Execute OR Execute in Terminal.
3.4	Scanning results
After running the setup.sh file, if you choose “Execute in Terminal”, you will see that the scan is started, and it will show your connected devices with their IP and Mac Addresses. Wait for a few minutes till the GUI starts.

3.5	The GUI app
When the completes, our GUI app will start. We’ve made it so simple, so the end users know how to use it.
You will see only 2 buttons on our GUI app. The first one is to see the scanning results in a good and an understandable format, and the second button is to exit the program.
When you click “Click here to see the results”, a second window will open, so you can get full results. You can select all the results, copy them, and paste them in a text file. BUT we’ve made easier for the users. Our tool will save the results in two separate files. The first file named “rev.txt” that would contain a list of all the connected devices with their names, IP addresses, and Mac addresses, and the second file named “results.txt” which is the most important one. It would contain a list of all vulnerable devices with their product names and CVEs.
Now, you can close the program by clicking “Exit Program” button.

3.6	The Email App

NOTE: We have updated the email app. You are no longer required to type the sender email and password. You can skip the EMAIL part on the video and continue here.
When you close the program, our email app will start. You will get two windows.
- In the box, type your email address that you want to send the results to.
- Click on “Attach” – this will attach the results.txt file automatically.
- Click on “Send”.

4-	Next Version and Updates:

4.1 How to update?
In order to keep following the latest updates of our IoT Scanner, you need to follow the scanner page on GitHub at https://github.com/adamatasi/IoT_Scanner 
We will keep pushing updates to make sure that our tool never expires.
What users need to do is to go to our scanner page, scroll down, and check the README file.
Check the version of the scanner. This is version 1.0 (v.1.0). If there is a new update, we will post the new version on that page and change that to something like “v.1.1” or “v.2.0”.
We will also upload the file to a cloud storage and give the link as well as a new video instruction.
If we were to make big changes, we would most likely make a new user manual and post it on the same page.

4.2 What’s coming?
Our next version of the scanner will include:
-	Better email delivery method so users don’t have to turn on “less secure apps” on their Google Accounts.
-	Better GUI looking app with more buttons so users can choose where to save the results.
-	Better results: That includes more details about each CVE and solutions.
-	Our next version will support Windows machines as well as Linux machines running on Virtual environments.

5-	 Summary:
Scans the network and lists all device IP addresses and MAC addresses. It will then allow the user to select a device and will be able to track this device’s detailed info This could help make the network more secure and be aware of potential threats.  
The main objective is to map out the IoT devices and their associated vulnerability. 
List all networks Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices with name and IP address
Compare scanned results for vulnerabilities by looking into the database
We used python3 to create scripts and execute them to achieve the goal
First, we divided the project into parts so we can work on it individually which would be 
1.	Execution script.
2.	Scanning network script Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
3.	Database to store scanned results.
4.	Scanning vulnerabilities with NVD.
5.	Result email delivery.
